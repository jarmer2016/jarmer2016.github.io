            <h2>Learn to Code in AR</h2>
            <p>My dissertation research explored whether learning to code in Augmented Reality was a more engaging way
                to learn compared to a on-screen 3D alternative. To research this, I created two applications that
                provided a block coding experience to the user,
                and their challenge was to use the code blocks to move the character Timmy to the finish line.</p>

                <li>SpriteKit</li>

            <h2>Tesla Model 3 UI</h2>
            <p>I've always liked Tesla's User Interface, and so I decided to recreate it as an exercise in practicing
                SwiftUI. I had recently purcahsed some Bluetooth-enabled bathroom scales, and I wondered if I could
                detect the scales in my app, and have the speedometer update depending on the weight I exerted on the
                scales. My curiosity got the better of me and I sucessfully managed to detect the scales in the app and
                updae my UI based on the input from the scales.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>SwiftUI</li>
                <li>MapKit</li>
                <li>CoreBluetooth</li>
            </ul>
